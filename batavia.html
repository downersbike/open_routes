    Short route to Batavia then up the Fox River trail to
  Geneva and Cafe 318</a></td>
  <td> Same as short route to Batavia but extends by
  going up the Fox river trail. Suitable more for slower
  speeds as the trail can get quite crowded. 318 cafe is
  a great spot with good coffee and gelato. </td>
