    Short route to Batavia then up the Fox River trail to
  Geneva and Cafe 318</a></td>
  <td> Same as short route to Batavia but extends by
  going up the Fox river trail. Suitable more for slower
  speeds as the trail can get quite crowded. 318 cafe is
  a great spot with good coffee and gelato. </td>

    Route to Batavia using Warrenville and Ferry then ET Tri course, into
  Geneva and back via Mack. </a></td>
  <td> Route to Batavia via Ferry including the overpass hump climb.
  refuel and bathroom stop at 7/11 in Batavia before carefully riding through
  town. Ride between deerpath road and Bliss is nasty.. 50mph and narrow.. but
  worth it! Bliss is.. well bliss.. a stunner of a road. Take Western ave
  into Geneva for a Latte and Gelato. Route uses Fox river trail to warm up
  then Mack road return (<b>NOTE: Brief riders about taking the trail when
  Mack swings to the left or they will get lost</b>) </td>
